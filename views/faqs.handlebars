        <br>
        <ol>
            <li class="qa-set">
                <p class="q">I got the details of my Santee. What next?</p>
                <p class="a">Awesome! Now you have an opportunity to put a smile on your Santee's face :) Check your Santee's wishlist. Any good?</p>
            </li>
            <li class="qa-set">
                <p class="q">My Santee has very unrealistic(or expensive) wishlist. What do I do?</p>
                <p class="a">That shouldn't stop a good Santa. Maybe time to follow your Santee on twitter or email & find out what he/she likes.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="qa-set">
                <p class="q">What should be the budget of the gift to my Santee?</p>
                <p class="a">A good Santee will never put the value on gifts. You can buy him/her anything which you think will make them happy. Just try not to go full lavish :P</p>
            </li>
            <li class="qa-set">
                <p class="q">My Santee doesn't have twitter handle. How do I know more about him/her?</p>
                <p class="a">Quite possible that your Santee doesn't use Twitter. No worries. You still have his/her email address which is verified(active). You can mail your Santee using anonymous email address & know more about his/her likings :)</p>
            </li>
            <li class="qa-set">
                <p class="q">My Santee haven't disclosed his/her address?</p>
                <p class="a">Your Santee might have privacy concerns. Again, you can directly email them. Just don't spam them</p>
            </li>
            <li class="qa-set">
                <p class="q">I didn't receive any gifts from my Santa?</p>
                <p class="a">To be honest, because of the nature of this secretsanta (open registrations) we cannot make sure whether your Santa will hold the spirit of the Christmas & send you the gifts too. But if you don't receive your gifts by 31st Dec then do let me know.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="qa-set">
                <p class="q">Will the identity of my Santa be revealed?</p>
                <p class="a">If the santa wants to disclose himself, then yes. Else no. But still, in some cases I might choose to disclose the details of your Santa only if you have some strong reason behind it</p>
            </li>
            <li class="qa-set">
                <p class="q">What does MySanta achieves from this?</p>
                <p class="a">Nothing. Except seeing some happy faces :) We do tie up with some sponsors/partners but that is only for the benefit of the participants. I don't take anything from them. Neither do I share your details with anyone(except your Santa)</p>
            </li>
            <li class="qa-set">
                <p class="q">I have some more questions</p>
                <p class="a">You know where to find me. Not in north pole. But on <a href="https://twitter.com/MySanta_in" target="_blank">@MySanta_in</a> or <a href="mailto:mysantaweb@gmail" target="_blank">mysantaweb@gmail.com</a> :)</p>
